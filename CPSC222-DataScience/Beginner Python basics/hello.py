print( "Hello, world!" )  # I can put a comment anywhere in my program. This is an INLINE comment.

# WHITE SPACE must be used carefully in Python
# Uncomment the next line and try to run the program.

#   userName = input( "What is your first name, please? " )

# print( 'Nice to meet you,', userName, '!' )

# Did you notice that we can use either 'single' or "double" quotes around strings?
# Both work! It's good style to be consistent within a given program. Or you might use "" for strings and '' for chars.

# Another way to do this:
# print( 'Nice to meet you ' + userName )  # This works because we are specifically concatenating strings

# Try this:
# x = 5
# print( 'hello' + x)
# What do you think is the problem?

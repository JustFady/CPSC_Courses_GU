Parts-of-speech tagging: identifying each word's part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.\n","1. Noun phrase extraction: locating groups of words that represent nouns, such as \"red brick factory\"\n","1.

Inter-language translation and language detection: powered by [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)\n","1. Inflection: pluralizing and singularizing words\n","1. Spell checking and spelling correction\n","1. Stemming: reducing words to their stems by removing prefixes or suffixes. For example, the stem of \"varieties\" is \"varieti\"\n","1. Lemmatization: like stemming, but produces real words based on the original words' context. For example, the lemmatization of \"varieties\" is \"variety\"\n","1. Word frequencies: determining how often each word appears in a corpus\n","1. WordNet integration: WordNet is a database used to find word definitions, synonyms, and antonyms\n","1.

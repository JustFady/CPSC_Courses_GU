This class was definetetly very enjoyable, I think especially now that I have some knowledge in computer science, I am able to comprehend and 
connect things a lot easier. my biggest "ah ha" moment was definetly during our JavaScript chapter, I've watched various people knowing how to 
using javascript, css, and html all at such a high level, but I was always fasicinated about what they can create just by a couple lines of code.
I really enjoyed being able to learn at my own speed and honestly, come to think of it, the discussions were very very nice to do, it forced me to
research something I wouldn't normally research, and then find out how its connected to something else which I would find cool, then just keep going
down at different pieces to find out what makes that thing the way it is. All these things are really important for me to learn because my brain always
just looks at one thing then wants to know what it means, then I find something related and then I want to understand that thing, this lets my find out things
and keep myself have always just a little bit of extra information just in case. While I do believe I will always be on the backend of things in computer science, 
that is where my brain likes to roam and I'm simply not creative enough compared to most other people to design websites, if anything I would like to do JavaScript
if I am involved in creating a website. This class was truly a joy though, I found it really exciting creating these things and looking at it, its one thing to look 
at console menus in terminals that yes I've created but they don't look nearly as nice as HTML + CSS documents and I am sure on day I will need to be familiar with these
things so as long as I stay up to date, I feel like I've gained a good familiarity in this skill.

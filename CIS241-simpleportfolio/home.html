Hello Everyone, My name is Fady Youssef. I am a 19 year old student here at Edmonds College, a little about 
me, I am an Egyptian born man but mainly grew up in Queens, New York before moving here to Washington 
something like 11 years ago. Outside class, I really love going on long runs or playing basketball, then 
beyond that, I do love playing strategy games such as sid meiers, and the sniper elite series. 

<p class="margin" style="font-size:25px;" style="font-family:'Courier New'">

I have been going to Edmonds College for about a little over a year now. I am currently working 
Towards getting my Bachelors in Computer Science hoping one day I can break into the field of 
Game development. I have dabbled in the past in HTML learning just simple tags, but never with 
complicated css or any javascript, so if this is looked back on some day, this is the first
official website I have ever created. 

<p class="margin" style="font-size:25px;" style="font-family:'Courier New'">

In the future I hope I can fully expand all my skills, I'm a person that is over ambitious at times 
which is bad at times, however, it does keep me chasing after something, because I always look for the
highest tier of things that I truly want. While I don't think this is possible just yet, I do hope one 
day I can learn full stack development or essentially just front and back end and a pretty high level to 
maybe one day do freelance and have time to grow other sources of income... maybe one day, maybe its the ambition :).

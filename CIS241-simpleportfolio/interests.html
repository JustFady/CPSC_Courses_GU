<li>Okay so like, I really love running, I'm not entirely sure why, I mean I have been on teams and what not, but its so beyond that.
Running to me is what keeps my world in balance, I consider myself a very even tempered person, I never like to disturb my calm, no
matter what kind of choas is around me. I just like to go out on nice courses that I try to find as I'm running, I try to run a solid 3-6
miles each day, depending whether some marathon is coming up or I want to work on speed and endurance, will depend on the distance I am running
for the week. Running is a very big hobby of mine and I doubt I will stop it as I continue in life, it does get sad at some points cause I do
injure myself sometimes and don't really care, like right now my entire bottom half of my right leg (Knee, shin, anklee) are all either 
have a bone bruise or some injury but I just keep running cause I just don't feel anything when I go. </li>

<p class="margin" style="font-size:25px;" style="font-family:'Courier New'">
<li>Another big hobby of mine is playing video games, with strategy + horror as being my all-time favorite generes. This does stem from
my love of horror films, I personally don't believe in any gods, or stuff like demons or angels or anything like that, but ironically
I do love the ideologies about it all about how someones spirit or whatever flies around and haunts people.. like casper :D I really just see stuff
like that as if its greek mythology its all really cool but a lot of it doesn't make sense to me. its all really
funny to me and video games take me from laughing at irrational people on a tv screen, into my being able to decide what to do and how to really
mess with what most people consider funny, if not I just go on dead by daylight to run in circles or go on COD: Zombies, idk I just like the thrill
of the strategy + something that I do kinda find ya know technically scary but I always find away to turn that fear into laughing :). </li>

<p class="margin" style="font-size:25px;" style="font-family:'Courier New'">
<li>My final and probably my biggest hobby though is actually just technology, ever since I was a kid I always liked messing with anything related 
to technology and that eventually turned into my pursing this degree. Most days, I'm usually on my computer either on web forms, discord with friends, 
school work, gaming, random coding projects, looking through things like medium and reddit for coding related stuff, all that I just enjoy so much more, 
like of course I do go to the gym and run and all that, but stuff like video games, running, and working out all take temporary portions of my day and 
the rest of it is usually behind either a desktop or laptop, and I honestly enjoy it. </li>
